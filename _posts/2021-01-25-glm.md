Random model component: the conditional distribution that $y$ follows given parameter.
eg. Exponential dispersion family $f(y|\theta)= \exp {\phi(y\theta-b(\theta))+c(y, \theta)}
Systematic component: the relationship between mean of $y$ and covariate $x$ through link function $g(\mu_i)=x_i'\beta = \eta_i$.
